<br>
Known mostly for his <span style="font-style: italic;">Lord
of the Rings</span> trilogy and other writings about Middle
Earth, Tolkien wanted to give England her own mythology. He maintained
that his work was never any kind of allegory; however many of his main
themes are still very much relevant to today's society. Political and
racial tensions, religious conflict, the drive for power, and the
ongoing struggle between good and evil form the basis of Tolkien's epic
and allow us to identify with his memorable characters. Perhaps most
impressive is that Tolkien invented all of the geography and languages
of Middle Earth. <br>
