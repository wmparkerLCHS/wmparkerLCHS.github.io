Stephenie Meyer was born on December 24, 1973. Though she has a degree
in English, she had never written even a short story before beginning
work on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Twilight</span>
series. Millions of fans have made her one of the top young adult
authors in the world, proving that vampires and werewolves make exactly
their brand of literature.<br>
